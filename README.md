**Clip-Connect PFA Frontend**

This is the frontend for Clip-Connect, a barber shop exploration website allowing users to find barber shops, view maps, and see barber statistics. The backend is available [here](https://github.com/Omrani7/Clip-Connect.git).

### Getting Started

This project is bootstrapped with Create React App. 

### Available Scripts to Run the Project

1. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Installs all necessary dependencies for the project.

2. **Start the development server**:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Launches the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will reload as you make changes, and lint errors will appear in the console.

3. **Run tests**:  
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   Starts the test runner in interactive watch mode.

4. **Build for production**:  
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Creates a production-ready build in the `build` folder, optimizing React for best performance. The build is minified, and filenames include hashes, making it ready for deployment.

5. **Eject configuration (optional)**:  
   ```bash
   npm run eject
   ```
   This is a one-way operation that copies configuration files into your project, giving you full control over them. **Note**: Once you eject, you cannot revert to the default setup.

**Note**: Ejecting is optional; the default configuration is suitable for most small and medium projects.
